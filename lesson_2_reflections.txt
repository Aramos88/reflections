How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

The Staging Area is the last chance to not commit any of the changes made to 
the files in matter.
The value that it offers is the opportunity of changing one's mind
*************************************************************************************

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

Once we "git add" a file we are working with, we still have the chance to peek 
at the initial "working" state of our code and the "staged" version of it, in order 
to make sure that we are indeed preparing a commit for 1 logical change.
*************************************************************************************

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized??
	In case we have decided to implement major modifications or alternative versions
	of our code, but still want to have a version of our "a priori" code.

How would branches help?
	Branches allow us to preserve a main version while working along with several
	modified versions.
	
**************************************************************************************

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
	Providing us with a clear representation of the changes made in time, and letting
	us know of the progress/changes that have been committed to different branches.

What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs always doing merges manually??
	AutomaticMerging provides a quick, effective way to sync any changes that are not 
	included in the same logical unit
	ManualMerging by the contrary provides a tune-and-pimp approach to solving conflicts
	always with the  presence of the human factor.
