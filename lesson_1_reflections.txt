How did viewing a diff between two 
versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

Having an old-doc line vs new-doc line view let's you easily detect
any changes for a specific line. 
Hence, it's way easier to detect any changes that "are not supposed"
to be there in a code.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file
make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

By giving us a tool to effectively detect any undesirable changes
exactly when they occurred in our project's lifetime.
